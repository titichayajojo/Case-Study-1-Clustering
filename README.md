# Case Study 1: Clustering

This project is part of the Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence for Data Scientists (M) COMPSCI5100 course at the University of Glasgow. The case study focuses on implementing clustering algorithms to analyze and group data effectively.

## Project Overview

- **Course**: Machine Learning & AI for Data Scientists (M) - COMPSCI5100
- **Objective**: To explore and apply clustering techniques on a dataset, evaluating the performance and insights derived from different algorithms.
- **Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, and relevant libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib).

## Files and Resources

- **`case_study1-2.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the clustering analysis.
- **`Case1 report.pdf`**: Detailed report summarizing the findings and methodologies used.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies required to run the project.
